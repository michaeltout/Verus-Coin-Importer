# Verus-Coin-Importer
A simple tool to create coin files to import into Verus Desktop.

## Usage & Installation
- To use the importer tool, you need node v12.0.0 or greater and yarn
- Currently, you can only import Komodo asset chains into Verus Desktop using this tool

1) Download this git repository to your computer
2) Using a terminal, cd into the repository
3) Run "yarn" in the terminal
4) Run "node index.js" in the terminal and answer the questions 
4) When you've filled out the form, double check that the created JSON file printed to your console is how you want it to be
5) A new file, "\<your coin ticker\>_import.txt" should be created inside the repository folder, this is your import file

## Testing your import file with Verus Desktop

1) Open Verus Desktop and navigate past the login/choose account screens to the wallet
2) Select "Add Coin" from the left side of the screen, a modal should appear with a searchable dropdown in the middle
3) Without the dropdown selected, within this modal, type "ADDFROMFILE" (or press the Option/Alt key three times), on your keyboard (without the quotes), the searchable dropdown should now be replaced by a file selector
4) Select "\<your coin ticker\>_import.txt" from the file selector, and press continue
5) Ensure that the buttons for the modes your coin supports arent grayed out (e.g. if your coin supports native mode, the native button is clickable)
6) Test each available mode to make sure it works, connects, can send, and gets all information properly
